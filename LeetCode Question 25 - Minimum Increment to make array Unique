LeetCode Question 25 - Minimum Increment to make array Unique

Description : You are given an integer array nums. In one move, you can pick an index i where 0 <= i < nums.length and increment nums[i] by 1.

Return the minimum number of moves to make every value in nums unique.

The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: After 1 move, the array could be [1, 2, 3].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,1,2,1,7]
Output: 6
Explanation: After 6 moves, the array could be [3, 4, 1, 2, 5, 7].
It can be shown with 5 or less moves that it is impossible for the array to have all unique values.

Solution : 
class Solution {
    public int minIncrementForUnique(int[] arr) {
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        int count = 0,tracker = 0;
        for(int i = 0;i<arr.length;i++){
            tracker = Math.max(tracker,arr[i]);
            count+=(tracker-arr[i]);
            tracker++;
        }
        return count;
    }
    
}
