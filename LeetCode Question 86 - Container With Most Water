LeetCode Question 86 - Container With Most Water

Description : You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

 

Example 1:


Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
Example 2:

Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1

Solution : 
class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] arr) {
        int low = 0, high = arr.length-1,area = 0,max = 0;
        while(low<high){
            area = (high-low) * Math.min(arr[high],arr[low]);
            if(area>max) max = area;
            if(arr[high]>arr[low]) low++;
            else high--;
        }
        return max;
    }
}
