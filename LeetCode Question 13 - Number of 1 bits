LeetCode Question 13 - Number of 1 bits

Description : Write a function that takes the binary representation of a positive integer and returns the number of 
set bits
 it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 11

Output: 3

Explanation:

The input binary string 1011 has a total of three set bits.

Example 2:

Input: n = 128

Output: 1

Explanation:

The input binary string 10000000 has a total of one set bit.

Solution:
class Solution {
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        for(int i = 0;i<32;i++){
            int mask = 1<<i;
            if((mask & n) != 0) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
