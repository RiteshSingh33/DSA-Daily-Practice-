LeetCode Question 64 - Next Greater Element I

Description : The next greater element of some element x in an array is the first greater element that is to the right of x in the same array.

You are given two distinct 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2, where nums1 is a subset of nums2.

For each 0 <= i < nums1.length, find the index j such that nums1[i] == nums2[j] and determine the next greater element of nums2[j] in nums2. If there is no next greater element, then the answer for this query is -1.

Return an array ans of length nums1.length such that ans[i] is the next greater element as described above.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2]
Output: [-1,3,-1]
Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
- 1 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. The next greater element is 3.
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [3,-1]
Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. The next greater element is 3.
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.


Solution : 
class Solution {
    public int[] nextGreaterElement(int[] arr1, int[] arr2) {
        Stack<Integer> st = new Stack<>();
        int[] nge2 = new int[arr2.length];
        for(int i = arr2.length-1;i>=0;i--){
            while(!st.isEmpty() && st.peek()<=arr2[i]) st.pop();
            if(st.isEmpty()) nge2[i] = -1;
            else nge2[i] = st.peek();
            st.push(arr2[i]);
        }
        int[] nge = new int[arr1.length];
        for(int i = 0;i<arr1.length;i++){
            int a = isPresent(arr2,arr1[i]);
            if(a==-1) nge[i] = -1;
            else nge[i] = nge2[a];
        }
        return nge;
    }

    public int isPresent(int[] arr , int a){
        for(int i = 0;i<arr.length;i++){
            if(arr[i]==a) return i;
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
