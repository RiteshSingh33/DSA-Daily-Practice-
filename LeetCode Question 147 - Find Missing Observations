LeetCode Question 147 - Find Missing Observations

Description : You have observations of n + m 6-sided dice rolls with each face numbered from 1 to 6. n of the observations went missing, and you only have the observations of m rolls. Fortunately, you have also calculated the average value of the n + m rolls.

You are given an integer array rolls of length m where rolls[i] is the value of the ith observation. You are also given the two integers mean and n.

Return an array of length n containing the missing observations such that the average value of the n + m rolls is exactly mean. If there are multiple valid answers, return any of them. If no such array exists, return an empty array.

The average value of a set of k numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by k.

Note that mean is an integer, so the sum of the n + m rolls should be divisible by n + m.

 

Example 1:

Input: rolls = [3,2,4,3], mean = 4, n = 2
Output: [6,6]
Explanation: The mean of all n + m rolls is (3 + 2 + 4 + 3 + 6 + 6) / 6 = 4.
Example 2:

Input: rolls = [1,5,6], mean = 3, n = 4
Output: [2,3,2,2]
Explanation: The mean of all n + m rolls is (1 + 5 + 6 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 2) / 7 = 3.
Example 3:

Input: rolls = [1,2,3,4], mean = 6, n = 4
Output: []
Explanation: It is impossible for the mean to be 6 no matter what the 4 missing rolls are.

Solution :
class Solution {
    public int[] missingRolls(int[] arr, int mean, int n) {
        int sum = 0,m = arr.length;
        for(int i : arr){
            sum+=i;
        }
        int remSum = (n+m) * mean - sum;
        if(remSum> 6*n || remSum<n) return new int[0];
        int[] res = new int[n];
        int eachP = remSum/n, rem = remSum % n;
        for(int i = 0;i<n;i++){
            int extra = 0;
            if(rem>0){
                rem--;
                extra = 1;
            }
            res[i] = extra + eachP;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
