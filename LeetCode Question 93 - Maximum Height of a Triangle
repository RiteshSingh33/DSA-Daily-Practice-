LeetCode Question 93 - Maximum Height of a Triangle

Description : You are given two integers red and blue representing the count of red and blue colored balls. You have to arrange these balls to form a triangle such that the 1st row will have 1 ball, the 2nd row will have 2 balls, the 3rd row will have 3 balls, and so on.

All the balls in a particular row should be the same color, and adjacent rows should have different colors.

Return the maximum height of the triangle that can be achieved.

 

Example 1:

Input: red = 2, blue = 4

Output: 3

Explanation:



The only possible arrangement is shown above.

Example 2:

Input: red = 2, blue = 1

Output: 2

Explanation:


The only possible arrangement is shown above.

Example 3:

Input: red = 1, blue = 1

Output: 1

Solution : 
class Solution {
    public int maxHeightOfTriangle(int red, int blue) {
        return Math.max(solve(red,blue), solve(blue,red));
    }
    public int solve(int a, int b){
        int i = 1,res = 0;
        while(true){
            if(i%2==1 && a>=i) a-=i;
            else if(i%2==0 && b>=i) b-=i;
            else break;
            i++;
            res++; 
        }
        return res;
    }
}
