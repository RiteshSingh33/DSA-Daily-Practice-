LeetCode Question 59 - Next Greater Element II

Description : Given a circular integer array nums (i.e., the next element of nums[nums.length - 1] is nums[0]), return the next greater number for every element in nums.

The next greater number of a number x is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array, which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, return -1 for this number.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,1]
Output: [2,-1,2]
Explanation: The first 1's next greater number is 2; 
The number 2 can't find next greater number. 
The second 1's next greater number needs to search circularly, which is also 2.

Solution : 
class Solution {
    public int[] nextGreaterElements(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;
        int[] a = new int[arr.length];
        Stack<Integer> st = new Stack<>();
        for(int i = 2*n - 1;i>=0;i--){
            while(!st.isEmpty() && st.peek()<=arr[i%n]){
                st.pop();
            }
            if(st.isEmpty()){
                a[i%n] = -1;
            }else{
                a[i%n] = st.peek();
            }
            st.push(arr[i%n]);   
        }
        return a;
    }
}
