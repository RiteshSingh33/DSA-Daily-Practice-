LeetCode Question 114 - Sum in a Matrix

Description : You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array nums. Initially, your score is 0. Perform the following operations until the matrix becomes empty:

From each row in the matrix, select the largest number and remove it. In the case of a tie, it does not matter which number is chosen.
Identify the highest number amongst all those removed in step 1. Add that number to your score.
Return the final score.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [[7,2,1],[6,4,2],[6,5,3],[3,2,1]]
Output: 15
Explanation: In the first operation, we remove 7, 6, 6, and 3. We then add 7 to our score. Next, we remove 2, 4, 5, and 2. We add 5 to our score. Lastly, we remove 1, 2, 3, and 1. We add 3 to our score. Thus, our final score is 7 + 5 + 3 = 15.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [[1]]
Output: 1
Explanation: We remove 1 and add it to the answer. We return 1.

Solution : 
class Solution {
    public int matrixSum(int[][] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;
        int m = arr[0].length;
        for(int[] row : arr){
            Arrays.sort(row);
        }
        int sum = 0,ans = 0;
        for(int j = m-1;j>=0;j--){
            ans = 0;
            for(int i = 0;i<n;i++){
                ans = Math.max(ans,arr[i][j]);
            }
            sum+=ans;
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
